# English word vectors

Directory for pre-trained word vectors. We have mainly used word vectors obtained from GGnews and Pubmed. We used gensim implementation of word2vec. Details are in the [en_word_emb_reduc.ipynb](https://github.com/strayMat/bio-medical_ner/tree/master/en_word_emb/en_word_emb_reduc.ipynb) which gives instruction and code to reduce the dimension of word vectors with PCA.
